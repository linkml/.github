## Welcome to LinkML ðŸ‘‹

LinkML is a flexible modeling language that allows you to author schemas in YAML that describe the structure of your data. Additionally, it is a framework for working with and validating data in a variety of formats (JSON, RDF, TSV), with generators for compiling LinkML schemas to other frameworks.
